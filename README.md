## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### **Accessibility-First Design**
- **High Contrast**: Optimized color schemes for partial vision
- **Large Touch Targets**: Easy interaction for users with motor difficulties
- **Screen Reader Support**: Full compatibility with accessibility tools
- **Haptic Feedback**: Tactile confirmations for all interactions

### **Intuitive User Experience**
- **Minimalist Interface**: Clean, uncluttered design reduces cognitive load
- **Consistent Navigation**: Predictable interaction patterns throughout app
- **Audio-First Approach**: Visual elements enhance rather than replace audio cues
- **Error Prevention**: Smart defaults and confirmation dialogs

### **Visual Design Elements**
```css
Primary Color:    #00FF88 (Bright Green)
Background:       #1A1A1A (Dark Gray)
Accent:           #00CC66 (Medium Green) 
Text Primary:     #FFFFFF (White)
Text Secondary:   #CCCCCC (Light Gray)
Warning:          #FF8800 (Orange)
